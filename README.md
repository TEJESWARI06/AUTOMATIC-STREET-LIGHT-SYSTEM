This project is an Automatic Street Light System designed to turn street lights on and off automatically based on ambient light levels. The system uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) as the primary sensor to detect surrounding light intensity. During the day, when sufficient light is available, the LDR resistance decreases and the lights remain off, thereby conserving energy. At night or in low-light conditions, the LDR resistance increases, which triggers the circuit to switch on the LED or street light using a transistor and relay module. The Arduino microcontroller acts as the brain of the system, processing the input from the LDR and controlling the output accordingly. Supporting components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, and the power supply ensure stable and efficient operation. This setup provides an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution for street lighting by automating the process and reducing unnecessary power consumption.
